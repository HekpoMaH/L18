abstract="This paper describes a system combining model-based and learning-based methods for automated reasoning in large theories, i.e. on a large number of problems that use many axioms, lemmas, theorems, definitions, and symbols, in a consistent fashion. The implementation is based on the existing MaLARea system, which cycles between theorem proving attempts and learning axiom relevance from successes. This system is extended by taking into account semantic relevance of axioms, in a way similar to that of the SRASS system. The resulting combined system significantly outperforms both MaLARea and SRASS on the MPTP Challenge large theory benchmark, in terms of both the number of problems solved and the time taken to find solutions. The design, implementation, and experimental testing of the system are described here.",

abstract="We applied two state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to the problem of selecting a good heuristic in a first-order theorem prover. Our aim was to demonstrate that sufficient information is available from simple feature measurements of a conjecture and axioms to determine a good choice of heuristic, and that the choice process can be automatically learned. Selecting from a set of 5 heuristics, the learned results are better than any single heuristic. The same results are also comparable to the prover's own heuristic selection method, which has access to 82 heuristics including the 5 used by our method, and which required additional human expertise to guide its design. One version of our system is able to decline proof attempts. This achieves a significant reduction in total time required, while at the same time causing only a moderate reduction in the number of theorems proved. To our knowledge no earlier system has had this capability.",

abstract="HOL Light is a new version of the HOL theorem prover. While retaining the reliability and programmability of earlier versions, it is more elegant, lightweight, powerful and automatic; it will be the basis for the Cambridge component of the HOL-2000 initiative to develop the next generation of HOL theorem provers. HOL Light is written in CAML Light, and so will run well even on small machines, e.g. PCs and Macintoshes with a few megabytes of RAM. This is in stark contrast to the resource-hungry systems which are the norm in this field, other versions of HOL included. Among the new features of this version axe a powerful simplifier, effective first order automation, simple higher-order matching and very general support for inductive and recursive definitions.",
