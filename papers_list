Hammer for Coq: Automation for Dependent Type Theory - not in detail, just interesting that Coq has hammer too
Safe Reinforcement Learning via Formal Methods - ??
Learning to Prove with Tactics - seems like an interesting improvement
Reinforcement Learning of Theorem Proving - 26 cites, reinforcment, seems fancy
